# E2E Repository for sg.nvim 

This repository is a copy of https://github.com/sourcegraph/conc, whose only purpose is to be 
used by end-to-end tests for [sg.nvim](https://github.com/sourceraph/sg.nvim). 

This means that this repository is not mean to be kept in sync, as we want the outputs from Cody
when asked about this repository to stay stable enough to we can express assertions used in the 
end-to-end tests.
